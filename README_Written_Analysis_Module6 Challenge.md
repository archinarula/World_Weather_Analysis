# Written Analysis of the World Weather Data Analysis with Web APIs

## Overview of Analysis
This project is about retreiving Weather data of over 2000 cities from websites and applying analysis , visualizations, statistical skills to help travellers in their trip plans. 

### Purpose
PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in travel recommendations and assist travellers in planning their itenary based on their selected criterias.  In this projecct we are retrieving weather data across 2000 random cities latitudes/longitudes, storing data in dataframes, cleaning the data and then using it to plot interactive maps using Google APIs. The basic data app with thsi weather data analysis is further being customized to add weather descriptions, provide travellers ability to filter data for their weather preferences to identify their travel destinations and nearby Hotels. Finally using the Google Maps Directions API, we will also create travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

#### Deliverable: This analysis and code consists of a following deliverables and a written report for the PlanMyTrip Weather App Data Analysis:

- Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Folder: https://github.com/archinarula/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Weather_Database
Files: Weather_Database.ipynb and WeatherPy_Database.csv

- Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Folder: https://github.com/archinarula/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Vacation_Search
Files:Vacation_Search.ipynb and WeatherPy_vacation.csv

- Deliverable 3:  Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Folder: https://github.com/archinarula/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Vacation_Itinerary
Files: Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb

#### NOTE TO EVALUATERS: I have tried all methods to install the gmaps widgets on conda and jupiter extensions. But my Jupiter notebook is just not displaying the image so unfortuantely I can't provide the images as part of my submission. you can see that in Github my code does show Fig outputs just those images are not viewable. I also asked lot of my colleagues and the TAs on weekend (Swomya, Upasana) and no one could help and they asked me to put this as a Note in Readme file for the evaluators attention. Hoping you will not cut lots of marks because of this. Thanks.

## Results
- Clear, clean weather data obtained via APIs
- Visually engaging Customer Travel Destinations Maps and Hotel informations
- Travel route between the four(choice) cities as well as a marker layer map to help travellers

## Summary: Using Python and APIs, very easily weather data was retrieved, cleaned, stored into Dataframes for further analysis and plotting via engaging Google Maps APIs
