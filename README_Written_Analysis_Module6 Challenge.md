# Written Analysis of the World Weather Data Analysis with Web APIs

## Overview of Analysis
This project is about retreiving Weather data of over 2000 cities from websites and applying analysis , visualizations, statistical skills to help travellers in their trip plans. 

### Purpose
PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in travel recommendations and assist travellers in planning their itenary based on their selected criterias.  In this projecct we are retrieving weather data across 2000 random cities latitudes/longitudes, storing data in dataframes, cleaning the data and then using it to plot interactive maps using Google APIs. The basic data app with thsi weather data analysis is further being customized to add weather descriptions, provide travellers ability to filter data for their weather preferences to identify their travel destinations and nearby Hotels. Finally using the Google Maps Directions API, we will also create travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

#### Deliverable: This analysis and code consists of a following deliverables and a written report for the PlanMyTrip Weather App Data Analysis:
- Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

- Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map


- Deliverable 3:  Create a Travel Itinerary Map

- ReadME analysis: 


## Results
- Clear, clean weather data obtained via APIs
- Visually engaging Customer Travel Destinations Maps and Hotel informations
- Travel route between the four(choice) cities as well as a marker layer map to help travellers

## Summary: Using Python and APIs, very easily weather data was retrieved, cleaned, stored into Dataframes for further analysis and plotting via engaging Google Maps APIs
